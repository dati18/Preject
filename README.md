# Preject
 Preject for Redi-School: RESTAURANT ORDERING SYSTEM

The IDEA:

- Create Class Menu
- Class Menu has 4 subclasses: Starter, MainCourse, Dessert, Drink
- Class MainCourse has 3 subclasses: Pork, Chicken, Beef, Vegan (kind of overkill now, maybe useful in the future)
- An ArrayList to store objects of each classes in Menu
- Menu will be displayed once
- Interface 'Comparable' was used to sort objects (not really use it yet)
- Switch-Case statement was use to choose dishes from Menu and add them to another ArrayList
- The order will be store in a .txt file
